# goos-erddap-demo
Notebooks presented as a series of webinars for GOOS in autumn 2023

If you don't have conda/Python on your computer, I recommend using [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)

To run the notebooks:
1. download this repo (green button in the top right)
2. create the environment with conda using the environment.yml file
3. launch jupyter-lab or jupyter notebooks
4. navigate to the notebooks and run the sequentially

If you don't have conda installed, you can try it out on Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/voto-ocean-knowledge/goos-erddap-demo/main)
